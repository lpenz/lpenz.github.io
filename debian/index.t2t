I used to keep a Debian repository under this path. It was sort of a
manual process. Nowadays, though, there free artifact repositories
that can be connected to CI servers that can be connected to the
github directly, so this lost the appeal.

The packages that were here can now all be found under
my page in packagecloud: https://packagecloud.io/lpenz/lpenz

The sources are still all in https://github.com/lpenz
