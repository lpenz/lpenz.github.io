# www.lpenz.org

This repository has the contents of my web page at http://www.lpenz.org/

The source itself is in the *devel* branch. After making changes, it is merged
on master, built and commited.

There is a lot of files generated with R, haskell, python, etc. Travis tests
everything before the merge is performed. Unfortunately, the build and commit
that follows the merge is manual.
