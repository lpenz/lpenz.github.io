        My notes on how to debianize a git repository now available online in the [Debianization with git-buildpackage $home$/articles/debgit/index.html] article

        The
        [Hard drive occupation prediction with R $home$/articles/df0pred-1/index.html]
        article shows how to predict future free partition occupation by using
        a simple linear regression.

        The second article on the "HD occupation" series,
        [Hard drive occupation prediction with R - Part 2 $home$/articles/df0pred-2/index.html],
        shows us where the linear regression breaks (hint: real life), and uses
        Monte Carlo simulations to build a more robust method.

        The [Haskell eDSL Tutorial - Shared expenses $home$/articles/hedsl-sharedexpenses/index.html]
        explores the concept of domain-specific-language in Haskell by tackling
        a practical problem: sharing trip expenses.

        [After the Deadline http://www.afterthedeadline.com/] is a English
        language checker used by [Wordpress.com http://wordpress.com/] amon
        others. I have built a command-line client for it: the
        [atdtool https://github.com/lpenz/atdtool], with a Debian package
        available in the [debian debian/index.html] page.

        The last article in the "HD occupation series",
        [Hard drive occupation prediction with R - Part 3 $home$/articles/df0pred-3/index.html],
        explores how we can use historical data and Monte Carlo simulations to
        predict the range of possible values for HD occupation at any point in
        the future.

        [Google sheets http://www.google.com/sheets/about/] is a great tool for
        collaboration. It's a spreadsheet where a team can simultaneously edit
        cells online, in a clear and consistent fashion. To ease the use of the
        product of this collaboration in other contexts, you can now use
        [google-spreadsheet-csv https://github.com/lpenz/google-spreadsheet-csv]
        to download and upload the CSV version of a sheet.

        I always use //watch// to monitor the output of Unix processes and wait
        for events. I sometimes wonder about the history of outputs. Enters
        [watchng https://github.com/lpenz/watchng], a python script that shows
        the output of a process along with the date-time, but only when this
        output changes between two consecutive runs.

        The [Probabilistic bug hunting $home$/articles/bugprobhunt/index.html]
        article shows us how to deal with software (or hardware, for that
        matter) bugs that do not have a deterministic behaviour.
